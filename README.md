# rodzaki.github.io

This is the public site for Rodzaki.

It is intentionally simple.
No frameworks.
No tracking.
No optimization for engagement.

The site exists as a place to post writing, ideas, and artifacts that benefit from being *present* rather than processed.

## Status
Active, evolving.

## Structure
- `index.html` — main entry point
- Additional pages may be added as needed

## Philosophy
This site favors clarity over polish, continuity over speed, and staying with ideas long enough for them to show their shape.
